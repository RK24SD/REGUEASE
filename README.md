# ReguEase

**AI-Powered Regulatory Compliance SaaS for Indian Startups**

ReguEase eliminates bureaucratic friction in starting and running a business in India. It automates company incorporation, DPIIT/Startup India recognition, GST/ROC/PF/ESIC compliance, and policy navigation — reducing time from 30–60 days to under 7 days and costs by 70–80% compared to traditional CAs.

## The Problem

Indian startups lose months and lakhs to:
- Multi-step MCA/GST/DPIIT filings
- Manual form-filling and document rejections
- Expensive & sometimes fraudulent intermediaries
- Fragmented tracking of 1,000+ evolving central/state regulations

Result: ~90% early-stage failure risk before product-market fit.

## Our Solution

ReguEase is an **AI-native RegTech platform** that delivers:

- Personalized onboarding quiz → tailored compliance roadmap
- Automated SPICe+ form filling & MCA21 submission
- DPIIT/Startup India recognition auto-application
- RAG-powered natural-language policy Q&A
- Secure document upload, validation & blockchain-anchored verification
- Predictive compliance calendar with automated reminders
- Labor code & gig-economy compliant tools
- Freemium model: Free basic → ₹499/mo Basic → ₹999/mo Pro

## Key Features (MVP)

- AI-generated incorporation roadmap in <2 minutes
- Guided document collection & auto-fill
- Mock/simulated government filing flows (real integrations in progress)
- Responsive, mobile-first interface (Hindi support planned)
- Subscription flow teaser

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + React Server Components + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State**: React hooks (Zustand planned for v2)
- **Backend** (planned): NestJS / FastAPI + PostgreSQL + LangChain + OpenAI/Grok API
- **Integrations** (roadmap): MCA21, GSTN, DigiLocker, Razorpay

## Current Status

- Ideation & prototype complete (February 2026)
- Functional frontend demo with guided wizard, quiz, roadmap, document upload, and simulated filing flow
- Backend & real government API integrations: in planning / early development
